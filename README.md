# Sports Quiz Website

This is our FED assignment 2 project 

For this project, we am creating a Sports Quiz website for users to use it. This website offers and exciting platform to test the knowledge and passion of users for various sports. Users can delve into trivia ranging from historical milestones to current events, challenging themselves and competing with friends to climb the leaderboard. Whether one's expertise is in football, basketball, volleyball or beyond, there's something for everyone to enjoy and learn from on this dynamic platform. Overall, it is a website where sports enthusiasts converge to celebrate their love for the game while putting in their knowledge to the ultimate test. 

## Design Process

For the design process, we want my website allow users test their sports knowledge and learn some new things from it. There are different categories of quiz that the users can choose from. I also planned on making a leaderboard for the users to compete against one another to see who have the most knowledge on sports.

If we were a user, we would want the website to have a home page that talks about the overview of the website and what it does. Also, we would want to have a leaderboard to compete against others. In addition, we feel that allowing feedbacks from the users will be good for ideas to improve the website.

## Features

## Technologies Used

- CSS (TO style the website to look nicer)
- Javascript (To add interactions between users and the website)
- JQuery (To simplify DOM manipulation)
- RestDB (To store the data)

## Testing 

1. Quiz:
    1. There are 10 questions in the quiz
    2. When users get the question correct, they gain a point 
    3. If the users get the question wrong, they do not gain anything and move on to the next question
    4. Once the 10 question is answered, users can choose to take a quiz again or save their scores
    5. They will be able to input their username and scores to save it into a database which is used in the leaderboard
    6. From there, they can take another quiz or go back to home page

2. Leaderboard:
    1. The leaderboard makes use of restDB and API to show the details of the users with the highest scores

3. Feedback:
    1. Users can input their feedback
    2. If there is nothing in the feedback. it will say 'Please provide your feedback before submitting'. If there is something, it will say 'You have submitted your feedback!'
